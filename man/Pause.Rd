\description{
This function prompts for return key and waits until the return is pushed to continue execution. It is used often to view plots coded in a loop one at a time allowing the user to control when the next plot should be displayed
}
\details{
The Pause function uses readline to wait until a newline character (produced by the Enter key) is given.  Instead of pressing Enter, a newline character can be used to automate this waiting time.
