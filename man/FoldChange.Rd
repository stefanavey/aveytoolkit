\usage{
FoldChange(x, condNum, condDen, conditions, grouping, log2Transform = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix or data.frame from which to calculate fold changes with samples in columns.}

\item{condNum}{a vector of condition(s) to be used as the numerator in the fold change calculation}

\item{condDen}{a vector of condition(s) to be used as the denominator in the fold change calculation}

\item{conditions}{a vector with length equal to the number of columns of x containing the condition labels between which to find the fold changes.}

\item{grouping}{a vector with length equal to the number of columns of x containing a grouping of the samples (e.g. subjects, cell lines, strains).}

\item{log2Transform}{when 'TRUE', log2 transformation will be applied to x before taking the FC. If 'FALSE' (default) no transformation is applied and x is ASSUMED to be already log transformed.}
}
\value{
a data.frame of the fold changes with one column for each fold change
}
\description{
Calculate the fold change between pairs of conditions in a matrix or data frame
}
\details{
FoldChange takes the fold change of log2 Transformed data by subtracting columns of the x dataframe or matrix depending on the conditions passed in.
